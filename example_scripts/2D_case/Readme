## Boundary condition in SORD

Type 0: Vacuum free-surface. Stress is zero in cells outside the boundary
Type 3: Rigid surface. Displacement is zero at the boundary.
Type 1: Mirror symmetry at the node. Normal displacement is zero at the
        boundary. Useful for a boundary corresponding to (a) the plane orthogonal
        to the two nodal planes of a double-couple point source, (b) the plane
        normal to the mode-III axis of a symmetric rupture, or (c) the zero-width
        axis of a 2D plane strain problem.
Type -1: Anti-mirror symmetry at the node. Tangential displacement is
        zero at the boundary. Useful for a boundary corresponding to (a) the nodal
        planes of a double-couple point source, (b) the plane normal to the
        mode-II axis of a symmetric rupture, or (c) the zero-width axis of a 2D
        antiplane strain problem.
Type 2: Mirror symmetry at the cell. Same as type 1, but centered on the
        cell.
Type -2: Anti-mirror symmetry at the cell. Same as type -1, but centered
        on the cell. Can additionally be used when the boundary corresponds to
        the slip surface of a symmetric rupture.
Type 10: Perfectly match layer (PML) absorbing boundary.

Example: a 3D problem with a free surface at Z=0, and PML absorbing
boundaries on all other boundary faces:

nn = (1000,1000,1000)
bc1 = (10, 10, 0)
bc2 = (10, 10, 10)

Example: a 2D antiplane strain problem with PML absorbing boundaries.
The number of nodes is 2 for the zero-width axis:

nn = (1000,1000,2) #nodal number of computational dimension; 2D requires 2 nodes out of plane
bc1 = (10, 10, -1)
bc2 = (10, 10, -1)

Example: a 2D inplane strain problem with PML absorbing boundaries.
The number of nodes is 2 for the zero-width axis:

nn = (1000,1000,2) #nodal number of computational dimension; 2D requires 2 nodes out of plane
bc1 = (10, 10, 1)
bc2 = (10, 10, 1)
